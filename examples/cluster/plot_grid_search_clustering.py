====================================================================
Selection of the optimal number of clusters based on agreement score
====================================================================

V-Measure is a score that grows when two cluster labeling assignments
agree on how to split a dataset, independently of the number of
splits. This measure is furthermore symmetric::

    v_measure_score(label_a, label_b) == v_measure_score(label_b, label_a)

The following demonstrates how it is possible to randomly split a dataset
into two overlapping subsets, perform clustering on each split (here
using k-means) and then measure their agreement on the intersection of
the two subsets.

This process can be repeated for various number of the parameter k
of k-means. The best V-Measure score can hence give us a hint on the
optimal value for the parameter k in a completely unsupervied fashion.

In order to find a robust estimate of the optimal agreement score, the
process can be repeated and averaged several times by boostrapping the
overlapping sets used for clustering.
