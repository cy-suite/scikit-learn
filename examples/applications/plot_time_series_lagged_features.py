Lagged Features for Time Series Forecasting
===========================================

This example demonstrates how pandas-engineered lagged features can be used
for time series forecasting with
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` on the Bike Sharing
Demand dataset.

See the example on
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_cyclical_feature_engineering.py`
for some data exploration on this dataset and a demo on periodic feature
engineering.

# Modeling Predictive Uncertainty via Quantile Regression
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Instead of modeling the expected value of the distribution of
# `Y|X` like the least squares and Poisson losses do, one could try to
# estimate quantiles of the conditional distribution.
#
# :math:`Y|X=x_i` is expected to be a random variable for a given data point `xi`
# because we expect that the number of rentals cannot be 100% accurately
# predicted from the features. It can be influenced by other variables
# not properly captured by the existing lagged features. For instance
# whether or not it will rain in the next hour cannot be fully anticipated
# from the past hours bike rental data. This is what we call aleatoric
# uncertainty.
#
# Quantile regression makes it possible to give a finer description of that
# distribution without making strong assumptions on its shape.
#
# The conditional 5th percentile (a.k.a. 0.05-quantile) can be estimated with:
gbrt_percentile_05 = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss="quantile", quantile=0.05)
evaluate_and_store_results("gbrt_percentile_05", gbrt_percentile_05, X, y, cv=ts_cv)

# The conditional median (0.50-quantile) can be estimated with:
gbrt_median = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss="quantile", quantile=0.5)
evaluate_and_store_results("gbrt_median", gbrt_median, X, y, cv=ts_cv)

# %%
# And finally the 0.95 quantile:
gbrt_percentile_95 = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss="quantile", quantile=0.95)
evaluate_and_store_results("gbrt_percentile_95", gbrt_percentile_95, X, y, cv=ts_cv)

# Here it's interesting to notice that the blue area between the 5% and 95%
# percentile estimators has a width that varies with the time of the day:
#
# - At night, the blue band is much narrower: the pair of models is quite
#   certain that there will be a small number of bike rentals. And furthermore
#   these seem correct in the sense that the actual demand stays in that blue
#   band.
# - During the day, the blue band is much wider: the uncertainty grows, probably
#   because of the variability of the weather that can have a very large impact,
#   especially on week-ends.
# - We can also see that during week-days, the commute pattern is still visible in
#   the 5% and 95% estimations.
# - Finally, it is expected that 10% of the time, the actual demand does not lie
#   between the 5% and 95% percentile estimates. On this test span, the actual
#   demand seems to be higher, especially during the rush hours. It might reveal that
#   our 95% percentile estimator underestimates the demand peaks. This could be be
#   quantitatively confirmed by computing empirical coverage numbers as done in
#   the :ref:`calibration of confidence intervals <calibration-section>`.

# Conclusion
# ------------------
# Through this example we explored time series forecasting using lagged
# features. We compared a naive regression (using the standardized
# :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`) with a proper time
# series evaluation strategy using
# :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit`. We observed that the
# model trained using :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`,
# having a default value of `shuffle` set to `True` produced an overly
# optimistic Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE). The results
# produced from the time-based split better represent the performance
# of our time-series regression model. We also analyzed the predictive uncertainty
# of our model via Quantile Regression. Predictions based on the 5th, 50th and
# 95th percentile using `loss="quantile"` provide us with a quantitative estimate
# of the uncertainty of the forecasts made by our time series regression model.
# Uncertainty estimation can also be performed
# using `MAPIE <https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_,
# that provides an implementation based on recent work on conformal prediction
# methods and estimates both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty at the same time.
# Furthermore, functionalities provided
# by `sktime <https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/users.html>`_
# can be used to extend scikit-learn estimators by making use of recursive time
# series forecasting, that enables dynamic predictions of future values.
