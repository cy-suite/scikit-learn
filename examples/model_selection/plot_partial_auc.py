=======================================================================
PAUC - Partial Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
=======================================================================

Example of setting False Positive Rate (FPR) or True Positive Rate (TPR)
limitations, and calculate partial AUC to evaluate binary classifier output
quality.

According to the definition of ROC, and as explained in
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_roc.py`, a larger area under
the curve (AUC) is usually better. However, in real life cases, we sometimes
have strict requirements on keeping low false positive rate, or keeping high
true positive rate, or both of them. In such scenarios, we are interested in a
portion of the ROC curve which satisfies certain restrictions.

For example, in fraud detection domain, there are requirements on building
binary classifiers to distinguish fraud behavior from normal behavior.
To reduce the workload of manually checking the model output on
false positive cases (normal behavior), we need to keep a low level of FPR.
At the same time, to mitigate the risk of missing fraud cases,
we need to keep a low level of false
negative rate (FNR). Please note that since `TPR = TP/P = (TP)/(TP + FN) = 1 -
FNR` , the limitation on low FNR is equivalent to the limitation on high TPR.


In :func:`sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score`, with the options ``max_fpr`` and
``min_tpr``, you could define the restrictions to ROC and get a standardized
partial AUC value returned, which could be used as your model selection
criteria.

Let's visualize a ROC example to clarify the definitions.
You could follow below
examples and manually calculate standardized pAUC for better understanding.

# Manual calculation on standardized pAUC for the above example
# ..........................................
# The partial AUC is the area of the region formed by "max_fpr",
# "min_tpr", and "ROC curve" lines. The pAUC value ``A = 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16``.
#
# According to the Formula 7 in [1]_,
# the standardized pAUC is
#
# .. math::
#    \frac{1}{2}\left ( 1 + \frac{A - min}{max - min} \right )
#
# where the max/min means the maximum/minimum value of AUC
# under the `max_fpr` and `min_tpr` restrictions.
#
# Following the ideas proposed by (McClish in 1989) [1]_,
# under ``max_fpr`` and ``min_tpr`` restrictions,
# we know the maximum area could attain is the rectangle with 4 endpoints:
# ``(0, min_tpr), (0, 1), (max_fpr, min_tpr), (max_fpr, 1)`` .
#
# Thus, the max area is ``(1 - min_tpr) * max_fpr = 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36``.
#
# The minimum area could attain is the triangle with 3 endpoints:
# ``(min_tpr, min_tpr), (max_fpr, min_tpr), and (max_fpr, max_fpr)``.
#
# Thus, the min area is
# ``0.5 * (max_fpr - min_tpr) * (max_fpr - min_tpr) = 0.045``.
#
# Finally, we get the standardized pAUC as
#
# .. math::
#    spauc =
#    \frac{1}{2}\left ( 1 + \frac{0.16 - 0.045}{0.36 - 0.045} \right )
#    \approx  0.6825
