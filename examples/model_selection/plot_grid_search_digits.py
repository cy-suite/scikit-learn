============================================================
Parameter estimation using grid search with cross-validation
============================================================

This examples shows how a classifier is optimized by cross-validation,
which is done using the :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` object
on a development set that comprises only half of the available labeled data.

The performance of the selected hyper-parameters and trained model is
then measured on a dedicated evaluation set that was not used during
the model selection step.

More details on tools available for model selection can be found in the
sections on :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search`.

# digits images.

# To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images.
# Each image of 8 by 8 pixels needs to be transformed to a vector of 64 pixels.
# Thus, we will get a final data array of shape (n_images, n_pixels)
n_samples = len(digits.images)
X = digits.images.reshape((n_samples, -1))

# Define our grid-search framework

# :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` instance. Here, the strategy
# is to short list the model which are the best in terms of precision and
# recall. From the selected models, we finally select the fastest model at
# predicting.
