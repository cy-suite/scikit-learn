Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is     linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\n\nPredicted attribute: class of iris plant.  \nThis is an exceedingly simple domain.  \n \n### Attribute Information:\n    1. sepal length in cm\n    2. sepal width in cm\n    3. petal length in cm\n    4. petal width in cm\n    5. class: \n       -- Iris Setosa\n       -- Iris Versicolour\n       -- Iris Virginica","format":"ARFF","creator":"R.A.
