    According to Ward's criterion, at each step during agglomerative
    clustering, the pair of clusters with minimum cluster distance are merged,
    where the cluster distance is the increase of within-cluster variance by
    merging two clusters.

    This increase in within-cluster variance when merging clusters A and B
    can be computed efficiently in constant time by using the formula
    d(A,B) = d(c_a,c_b)**2/(1/n_a + 1/n_b)
    where c_a denotes the centroid of cluster A and n_a the number of elements
    in cluster A.
