class BisectKMeans(KMeans):
    """Bisecting K-Means clustering.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <bisect_k_means>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'} or callable, default='k-means++'
        Method for initialization:

        'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
        clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
        Notes in k_init for more details.

        'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
        for the initial centroids.

        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
        random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the inner k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds in each bisection.
        That will result producing for each bisection best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    max_iter : int, default=30
        Maximum number of iterations of the inner k-means algorithm at each
        bisection.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations  to declare
        convergence. Used in inner k-means algorithm at each bisection to pick
        best possible clusters.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

    algorithm : {"auto", "full", "elkan"}, default="auto"
        K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is "full".
        The "elkan" variation is more efficient on data with well-defined
        clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's more memory
        intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        (n_samples, n_clusters).
        For now "auto" (kept for backward compatibiliy) chooses "elkan" but it
        might change in the future for a better heuristic.

    bisect_strategy : {"biggest_sse", "largest_cluster"}, default="biggest_sse"
        Defines how should bisection by performed:

        - "biggest_sse" means that Bisect K-Means will always check
            all calculated cluster for cluster with biggest SSE
            (Sum of squared errors) and bisect it. This approach concentrates on
            precision, but may be costly in terms of execution time (especially for
            larger ammount of data points).

        - "largest_cluster" - Bisect K-Means will always split cluster with
            largest amount of points assigned to it from all clusters
            previously calculated. That should work faster than picking by SSE
            ('biggest_sse') and may produce similar results in most cases.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers. If the algorithm stops before fully
        converging (see ``tol`` and ``max_iter``), these will not be
        consistent with ``labels_``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point.

    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center,
        weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    See Also
    --------
    KMeans : Original implementation of K-Means algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    Bisection cannot be performed if n_cluster < 2.
    Despite that in case when n_cluster == 1 - centroid will be created and points
    will be assigned to it.

    Also it might be inefficient when n_cluster is equal to 2, due to unnecassary
    calculations for that case.
