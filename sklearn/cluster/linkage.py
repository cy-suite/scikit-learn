class CompleteLinkage(Linkage):
    """ Complete Linkage criterion for hierarchical clustering

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        feature matrix  representing n_samples samples to be clustered

    connectivity : sparse matrix.
        connectivity matrix. Defines for each sample the neighboring samples
        following a given structure of the data. The matrix is assumed to
        be symmetric and only the upper triangular half is used.

    metric : function or str
        A metric string that is understood by scipy.spatial.distance.pdist
        or a binary function that returns for two datapoints their distance.
        Defaults to "euclidean".

        Note: it is typically much faster to pass a string than a function
              when using precompute_distances.

    distance_matrix: array of shape (n_samples, n_samples) or None
        A matrix which stores at index (i,j) the distance between X[i,:] and
        X[j,:]. If this matrix is given, the passed metric is ignored.
        Defaults to None.

    precompute_distances : bool
        If True, the distance between two datapoints are computed all initially
        and then stored in distance_matrix. This is typically faster then
        computing distances only when required but may require memory that
        grows quadratically with the number of samples. Defaults to True.

        Note: this parameter is ignored if a non-None distance_matrix is
              passed.
