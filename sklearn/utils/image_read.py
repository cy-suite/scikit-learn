def _imread(name, flatten=False, mode=None):
    """
    Read an image from a file as an array.
    This function is only available if Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.
    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str or file object
        The file name or file object to be read.
    flatten : bool, optional
        If True, flattens the color layers into a single gray-scale layer.
    mode : str, optional
        Mode to convert image to, e.g. ``'RGB'``.  See the Notes for more
        details.
    Returns
    -------
    imread : ndarray
        The array obtained by reading the image.
    Notes
    -----
    `imread` uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to read an image.
    The following notes are from the PIL documentation.
    `mode` can be one of the following strings:
    * 'L' (8-bit pixels, black and white)
    * 'P' (8-bit pixels, mapped to any other mode using a color palette)
    * 'RGB' (3x8-bit pixels, true color)
    * 'RGBA' (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask)
    * 'CMYK' (4x8-bit pixels, color separation)
    * 'YCbCr' (3x8-bit pixels, color video format)
    * 'I' (32-bit signed integer pixels)
    * 'F' (32-bit floating point pixels)
    PIL also provides limited support for a few special modes, including
    'LA' ('L' with alpha), 'RGBX' (true color with padding) and 'RGBa'
    (true color with premultiplied alpha).
    When translating a color image to black and white (mode 'L', 'I' or
    'F'), the library uses the ITU-R 601-2 luma transform::
        L = R * 299/1000 + G * 587/1000 + B * 114/1000
    When `flatten` is True, the image is converted using mode 'F'.
    When `mode` is not None and `flatten` is True, the image is first
    converted according to `mode`, and the result is then flattened using
    mode 'F'.
