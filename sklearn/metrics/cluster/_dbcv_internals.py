    Compute the density separation between two clusters. This is the minimum

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        The input data of the clustering. This can be the data, or, if
        metric is set to `precomputed` the pairwise distance matrix used
        for the clustering.

    labels : array (n_samples)
        The label array output by the clustering, providing an integral
        cluster label to each data point, with -1 for noise points.

    cluster_id1 : integer
        The first cluster label to compute separation between.

    cluster_id2 : integer
        The second cluster label to compute separation between.

    internal_nodes1 : array
        The vertices of the MST for `cluster_id1` that were internal vertices.

    internal_nodes2 : array
        The vertices of the MST for `cluster_id2` that were internal vertices.

    core_distances1 : array (size of cluster_id1,)
        The all-points-core_distances of all points in the cluster
        specified by cluster_id1.

    core_distances2 : array (size of cluster_id2,)
        The all-points-core_distances of all points in the cluster
        specified by cluster_id2.

    metric : string
        The metric used to compute distances for the clustering (and
        to be re-used in computing distances for mr distance). If
        set to `precomputed` then X is assumed to be the precomputed
        distance matrix between samples.

        metrics, such as minkowski, Mahanalobis etc.
