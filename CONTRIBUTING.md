# Introduction

If you're interested in contributing to scikit-learn, whether through code, documentation, bug investigation, or other means, you're making a valuable contribution to the project's growth and success. Here, we outline various ways you can get involved and help improve scikit-learn.

## Documentation Contributions

Contributing to the documentation is just as important as enhancing the library itself. Whether you spot a typo or have made improvements, we encourage you to notify us. You can either send an email to the mailing list or, preferably, submit a pull request on GitHub. You can find the documentation under the `doc/` directory in the scikit-learn repository.

## Code Contributions

One of the primary ways to contribute is by submitting code enhancements or bug fixes. If you're interested in this avenue, please follow the guidelines provided in our [Contributing Code](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#contributing-code) section.

## Reviewing Contributions

Reviewing other developers' pull requests is another valuable way to contribute. Your feedback and insights help lighten the load on project maintainers. Check out our Code Review [Guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#code-review-guidelines) to get started.

## Issue Tracker Participation

Answering queries on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues) and investigating bugs are highly appreciated contributions. This assistance is instrumental in resolving issues and improving the project's overall quality.

## Reporting and Acknowledging Issues

You can also contribute by reporting issues you encounter or giving a "thumbs up" to issues reported by others that are relevant to you. This simple act of engagement helps us prioritize and address problems effectively.

## Spreading the Word

Help us by spreading the word about scikit-learn. You can reference the project in your blog posts, articles, or on your website. Additionally, you can show your support by starring the project on GitHub to indicate that you use and appreciate it.
