### Logo Integrity

#### Minimum Size
For consistent legibility, please do not display the scikit-learn logo at less than 50px wide.

#### Clear Space
To ensure the mark is clearly visible in all uses, surround it with a sufficient amount of clear space that is free of type, graphics, and other elements that might cause visual clutter. Do not overlap the logo with text, images, or other elements. The minimum clear space required for the logo is .25X, where X is the height of the logo.
