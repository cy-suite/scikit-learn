Tuning cut-off decision threshold for class prediction
======================================================

Classifiers are predictive models: they use statistical learning to predict outcomes.
The outcomes of a classifier are scores for each sample in relation to each class and
categorical prediction (class label). Scores are obtained from :term:`predict_proba` or
:term:`decision_function`. The former returns posterior probability estimates for each
class, while the latter returns a decision score for each class. The decision score is a
measure of how strongly the sample is predicted to belong to the positive class (e.g.,
the distance to the decision boundary). In binary classification, a decision rule is
then defined by thresholding the scores, leading to a single class label for each
sample. Those labels are obtained with :term:`predict`.

For binary classification in scikit-learn, class labels are obtained by associating the
positive class with posterior probability estimates greater than 0.5 (obtained with
:term:`predict_proba`) or decision scores greater than 0 (obtained with
:term:`decision_function`).

Here, we show an example that illustrates the relation between posterior
probability estimates and class labels::

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    >>> X, y = make_classification(random_state=0)
    >>> classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0).fit(X, y)
    >>> classifier.predict_proba(X[:4])
    array([[0.94     , 0.06     ],
           [0.94     , 0.06     ],
           [0.0416..., 0.9583...],
           [0.0416..., 0.9583...]])
    >>> classifier.predict(X[:4])
    array([0, 0, 1, 1])

While these approaches are reasonable as default behaviors, they are not ideal for
all cases. Let's illustrate with an example.

Let's consider a scenario where a predictive model is being deployed to assist medical
doctors in detecting tumors. In this setting, doctors will be most likely interested in
correctly identifying all patients with cancer so that they can provide them with the
right treatment. In other words, doctors prioritize achieving a high recall rate,
meaning they want to identify all cases of cancer without missing any patients who have
it. This emphasis on recall comes, of course, with the trade-off of potentially more
false-positive predictions, reducing the precision of the model, but that is a risk
doctors are willing to take. Consequently, when it comes to deciding whether to classify
a patient as having cancer or not, it may be more beneficial to classify them as
positive for cancer when the posterior probability estimate is lower than 0.5.

Post-tuning the decision threshold
==================================

One solution to address the problem stated in the introduction is to tune the decision
threshold of the classifier once the model has been trained. The
:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TunedThresholdClassifier` tunes this threshold using an
internal cross-validation. The optimum threshold is chosen to maximize a given metric
with or without constraints.

The following image illustrates the tuning of the cut-off point for a gradient boosting
classifier. While the vanilla and tuned classifiers provide the same Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall curves, and thus the same
:term:`predict_proba` outputs, the class label predictions differ because of the tuned
decision threshold. The vanilla classifier predicts the class of interest for a
posterior probability greater than 0.5 while the tuned classifier predicts the class of
interest for a very low probability (around 0.02). This cut-off point optimizes a
utility metric defined by the business (in this case an insurance company).

Options to tune the cut-off point
---------------------------------

The cut-off point can be tuned through different strategies controlled by the parameter
`objective_metric`.

One way to tune the threshold is by maximizing a pre-defined scikit-learn metric. These
metrics can be found by calling the function :func:`~sklearn.metrics.get_scorer_names`.
In this example, we maximize the balanced accuracy.

.. note::

    It is important to notice that these metrics come with default parameters, notably
    the label of the class of interested (i.e. `pos_label`). Thus, if this label is not
    the right one for your application, you need to define a scorer and pass the right
    `pos_label` (and additional parameters) using the
    :func:`~sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`. Refer to :ref:`scoring` to get
    information to define your own scoring function. For instance, we show how to pass
    the information to the scorer that the label of interest is `0` when maximizing the
    :func:`~sklearn.metrics.f1_score`:

        >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        >>> from sklearn.model_selection import (
        ...     TunedThresholdClassifier, train_test_split
        ... )
        >>> from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, f1_score
        >>> X, y = make_classification(
        ...    n_samples=1_000, weights=[0.1, 0.9], random_state=0)
        >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
        >>> pos_label = 0
        >>> scorer = make_scorer(f1_score, pos_label=pos_label)
        >>> base_model = LogisticRegression()
        >>> model = TunedThresholdClassifier(base_model, objective_metric=scorer).fit(
        ...     X_train, y_train)
        >>> scorer(model, X_test, y_test)
        0.79...
        >>> # compare it with the internal score found by cross-validation
        >>> model.objective_score_
        0.86...

A second strategy aims to maximize one metric while imposing constraints on another
metric. There are four pre-defined options, two use the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) statistics and two use the Precision-Recall statistics.

- `"max_tpr_at_tnr_constraint"`: maximizes the True Positive Rate (TPR) such that the
  True Negative Rate (TNR) is the closest to a given value.
- `"max_tnr_at_tpr_constraint"`: maximizes the TNR such that the TPR is the closest to
  a given value.
- `"max_precision_at_recall_constraint"`: maximizes the precision such that the recall
  is the closest to a given value.
- `"max_recall_at_precision_constraint"`: maximizes the recall such that the precision
  is the closest to a given value.

For these options, the `constraint_value` parameter needs to be defined. In addition,
you can use the `pos_label` parameter to indicate the label of the class of interest.

Important notes regarding the internal cross-validation
-------------------------------------------------------

By default :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TunedThresholdClassifier` uses a 5-fold
stratified cross-validation to tune the cut-off point. The parameter `cv` allows to
control the cross-validation strategy. It is possible to bypass cross-validation by
setting `cv="prefit"` and providing a fitted classifier. In this case, the cut-off point
is tuned on the data provided to the `fit` method.

However, you should be extremely careful when using this option. You should never use
the same data for training the classifier and tuning the cut-off point due to the risk
of overfitting. Refer to the following example section for more details (cf.
:ref:`tunedthresholdclassifier_no_cv`). If you have limited resources, consider using a
float number to limit to an internal single train-test split.

The option `cv="prefit"` should only be used when the provided classifier was already
trained, and you just want to find the best cut-off using a new validation set.

Manually setting the decision threshold
---------------------------------------

The previous sections discussed strategies to find an optimal decision threshold. It is
also possible to manually set the decision threshold in
:class`~sklearn.model_selection.TunedThresholdClassifier` by setting the parameter
`strategy` to `"constant"` and providing the desired threshold using the parameter
`constant_threshold`.
