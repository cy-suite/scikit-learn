occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

- |Efficiency| Speed up :class:`neighrbors._dist_metrics.SEuclideanDistance`,
  :class:`neighrbors._dist_metrics.WMinkowskiDistance`,
  :class:`neighrbors._dist_metrics.MahalanobisDistance` and
  :class:`neighrbors._dist_metrics.HaversineDistance` by avoiding unexpected
  GIL acquiring in Cython, and by performing data validation in
  :func:`_validate_data` instead of in loops of calling
  :func:`dist` or :func:`rdist`. :pr:`17038` by :user:`Wenbo Zhao`.
