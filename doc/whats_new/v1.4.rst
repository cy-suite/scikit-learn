Version 1.4.0
=============

**In Development**

.. include:: changelog_legend.inc

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

Changelog

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

- |Enhancement| All estimators now recognizes the column names from any dataframe
  that adopts the
  `DataFrame Interchange Protocol <https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html>`__.
  Dataframes that return a correct representation through `np.asarray(df)` is expected
  to work with our estimators and functions.
  :pr:`26464` by `Thomas Fan`_.

Code and Documentation Contributors
-----------------------------------

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the maintenance and improvement of
the project since version 1.3, including:

TODO: update at the time of the release.

:mod:`sklearn.base`
...................

- |Enhancement| :meth:`base.ClusterMixin.fit_predict` and
  :meth:`base.OutlierMixin.fit_predict` now accept ``**kwargs`` which are
  passed to the ``fit`` method of the the estimator. :pr:`26506` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

:mod:`sklearn.decomposition`
............................

- |Fix| :meth:`decomposition.SparseCoder.transform` now preserves data
  types of transformed input ``X`` based on ``preserve_dtypes`` parameter.
  :pr:`26691` by :user:`SHREESHA KUMAR BHAT<Shreesha3112>`.

- |Fix| :func:`decomposition.tests.test_dict_learning_online_numerical_consistency`
  now uses precomputed_dictionary insted of ``X.T`` for ``dictionary`` parameter of
  :class:`decomposition.SparseCoder`. :pr:`26691` by :user:`SHREESHA KUMAR BHAT<Shreesha3112>`.

:mod:`sklearn.utils`
....................

- |Enhancement| :func:`utils.estimator_checks._construct_instance` now accepts
  ``dictionary`` in ``_required_parameters`` and constructs :class:`decomposition.SparseCoder` instance.
  :pr:`26691` by :user:`SHREESHA KUMAR BHAT<Shreesha3112>`.
