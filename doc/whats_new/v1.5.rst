    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123455 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

Code and Documentation Contributors
-----------------------------------

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the maintenance and improvement of
the project since version 1.4, including:

TODO: update at the time of the release.

:mod:`sklearn.compose`
......................

- |Feature| A fitted :class:`compose.ColumnTransformer` now implements `__getitem__`
  which returns the fitted transformers by name. :pr:`27990` by `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................

- |Feature| :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` got the new parameter
  `post_fit_calibration` to recalibrate the model: In link space, a constant is added
  such that on the training set (without the validation set), the balance property of
  equal observed average and predicted average holds.
  :pr:`26311` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.
