Free-threaded CPython 3.13 support
----------------------------------

scikit-learn has preliminary support for free-threaded CPython, in particular
free-threaded wheels are available for all of our supported platforms.

Free-threaded CPython 3.13 is an experimental version of CPython 3.13 that removes
the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) with the goal of enabling efficient
multi-threaded use cases in Python.

For more details about free-threaded CPython see `py-free-threading doc <https://py-free-threading.github.io>`_,
in particular `how to install a free-threaded CPython <https://py-free-threading.github.io/installing_cpython/>`_
and `Ecosystem Compatibility tracking <https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/>`_.

Feel free to try free-threaded on your use case and report any issues!
