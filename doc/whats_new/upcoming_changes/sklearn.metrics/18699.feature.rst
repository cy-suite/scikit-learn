- :func:`metrics.multiclass_brier_score_loss` implements the Brier
  loss for multiclass classification problems with values in the [0, 2] range
  (lower is better). This metric is notably useful to assess the calibration of
  probablistic classifiers. It can also be used on binary classification
  problems but this does not exactly match the usual convention used for the
  binary classification case implemented in :func:`metrics.brier_score_loss`
  that takes value in the [0, 1] range. See the docstrings for more details.
