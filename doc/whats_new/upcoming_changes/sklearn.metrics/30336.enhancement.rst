- :func:`sklearn.metrics.adjusted_r2_score`, a new function to calculate the 
  adjusted RÂ² score for regression models. This metric accounts for the number of 
  predictors, making it a more reliable performance measure, especially when comparing 
  models with different numbers of features. It supports sample weights and handles 
  edge cases with constant data.
