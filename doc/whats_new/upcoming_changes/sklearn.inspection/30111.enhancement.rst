- Add `max_memory_mb` parameter to `partial_dependence` to control the memory
  footprint during the computation of partial dependence when `method="brute"`.
  A large value allows for bigger batches, reducing overheads, and thus
  allowing some computation speed-up at the cost of a larger memory footprint.
