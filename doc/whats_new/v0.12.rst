Changelog
---------

   - Various speed improvements of the :ref:`decision trees <tree>` module, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now support feature subsampling
     via the ``max_features`` argument, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added Huber and Quantile loss functions to
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - :ref:`Decision trees <tree>` and :ref:`forests of randomized trees <forest>`
     now support multi-output classification and regression problems, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Added :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder`, a simple utility class to
     normalize labels or transform non-numerical labels, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added the epsilon-insensitive loss and the ability to make probabilistic
     predictions with the modified huber loss in :ref:`sgd`, by
     `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added :ref:`multidimensional_scaling`, by Nelle Varoquaux.

   - SVMlight file format loader now detects compressed (gzip/bzip2) files and
     decompresses them on the fly, by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - SVMlight file format serializer now preserves double precision floating
     point values, by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - A common testing framework for all estimators was added, by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Understandable error messages for estimators that do not accept
     sparse input by `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - Speedups in hierarchical clustering by `Gael Varoquaux`_. In
     particular building the tree now supports early stopping. This is
     useful when the number of clusters is not small compared to the
     number of samples.

   - Add MultiTaskLasso and MultiTaskElasticNet for joint feature selection,
     by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.auc_score` and
     :func:`metrics.average_precision_score` convenience functions by `Andreas
     Müller`_.

   - Improved sparse matrix support in the :ref:`feature_selection`
     module by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - New word boundaries-aware character n-gram analyzer for the
     :ref:`text_feature_extraction` module by :user:`@kernc <kernc>`.

   - Fixed bug in spectral clustering that led to single point clusters
     by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, added an option to
     ignore infrequent words, ``min_df`` by  `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Add support for multiple targets in some linear models (ElasticNet, Lasso
     and OrthogonalMatchingPursuit) by `Vlad Niculae`_ and
     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Fixes in :class:`decomposition.ProbabilisticPCA` score function by Wei Li.

   - Fixed feature importance computation in
     :ref:`gradient_boosting`.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - The old ``scikits.learn`` package has disappeared; all code should import
     from ``sklearn`` instead, which was introduced in 0.9.

   - In :func:`metrics.roc_curve`, the ``thresholds`` array is now returned
     with it's order reversed, in order to keep it consistent with the order
     of the returned ``fpr`` and ``tpr``.

   - In :class:`hmm` objects, like :class:`hmm.GaussianHMM`,
     :class:`hmm.MultinomialHMM`, etc., all parameters must be passed to the
     object when initialising it and not through ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will
     only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - For all SVM classes, a faulty behavior of ``gamma`` was fixed. Previously,
     the default gamma value was only computed the first time ``fit`` was called
     and then stored. It is now recalculated on every call to ``fit``.

   - All ``Base`` classes are now abstract meta classes so that they can not be
     instantiated.

   - :func:`cluster.ward_tree` now also returns the parent array. This is
     necessary for early-stopping in which case the tree is not
     completely built.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` the parameters
     ``min_n`` and ``max_n`` were joined to the parameter ``n_gram_range`` to
     enable grid-searching both at once.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, words that appear
     only in one document are now ignored by default. To reproduce
     the previous behavior, set ``min_df=1``.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`linear_model.SGDClassifier.predict_proba` now
     returns 2d array when fit on two classes.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis.decision_function`
     and :meth:`discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.decision_function` now return 1d arrays
     when fit on two classes.

   - Grid of alphas used for fitting :class:`linear_model.LassoCV` and
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` is now stored
     in the attribute ``alphas_`` rather than overriding the init parameter
     ``alphas``.

   - Linear models when alpha is estimated by cross-validation store
     the estimated value in the ``alpha_`` attribute rather than just
     ``alpha`` or ``best_alpha``.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now supports
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict_proba`, and
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict`.

   - :class:`svm.sparse.SVC` and other sparse SVM classes are now deprecated.
     The all classes in the :ref:`svm` module now automatically select the
     sparse or dense representation base on the input.

   - All clustering algorithms now interpret the array ``X`` given to ``fit`` as
     input data, in particular :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` and
     :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` which previously expected affinity matrices.

   - For clustering algorithms that take the desired number of clusters as a parameter,
     this parameter is now called ``n_clusters``.
