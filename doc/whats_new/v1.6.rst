.. Changelog management has changed in v1.6.0.
.. To add your changelog, create a file under the right folder under
.. `doc/whats_new/upcoming_changes` with file format `<PULL REQUEST>.<TYPE>.rst`, where
.. `<PULL REQUEST>` is a pull request number, and `<TYPE>` is one of:
.. * `major-feature`
.. * `feature`
.. * `efficiency`
.. * `enhancement`
.. * `fix`
.. * `api`
.. Example of a changelog file:

..   now supports missing values in the data matrix `X`. Missing-values are
..   handled by randomly moving all of the samples to the left, or right child
..   node as the tree is traversed.
