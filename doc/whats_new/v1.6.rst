  DELETE WHEN 1.6.0 IS RELEASED
  Starting from v1.6.0, scikit-learn will be using `towncrier` to manage the
  changelog. Each changelog entry should be it's own file and live in
  `doc/whats_new/upcoming_changes/`, within the relevant module named folder.
  The file should be named with the format `<PR_number>.<type>.rst`, and
  contain a single bullet point changelog entry, with user name but without PR
  number.
  See `doc/whats_new/upcoming_changes/README.md` for full details.
