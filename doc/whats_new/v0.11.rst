Highlights
.............

   - Gradient boosted regression trees (:ref:`gradient_boosting`)
     for classification and regression by `Peter Prettenhofer`_
     and `Scott White`_ .

   - Simple dict-based feature loader with support for categorical variables
     (:class:`feature_extraction.DictVectorizer`) by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added Matthews correlation coefficient (:func:`metrics.matthews_corrcoef`)
     and added macro and micro average options to
     :func:`metrics.precision_score`, :func:`metrics.recall_score` and
     :func:`metrics.f1_score` by `Satrajit Ghosh`_.

   - :ref:`out_of_bag` of generalization error for :ref:`ensemble`
     by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - :ref:`randomized_l1`: Randomized sparse linear models for feature
     selection, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - :ref:`label_propagation` for semi-supervised learning, by Clay
     Woolam. **Note** the semi-supervised API is still work in progress,
     and may change.

   - Added BIC/AIC model selection to classical :ref:`gmm` and unified
     the API with the remainder of scikit-learn, by `Bertrand Thirion`_

   - Added :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`, which is
     a :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` with balanced splits,
     by Yannick Schwartz.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid` classifier added, along with a
     ``shrink_threshold`` parameter, which implements **shrunken centroid
     classification**, by `Robert Layton`_.

Other changes
..............

   - Merged dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`sgd` module and
     exposed utility extension types for sequential
     datasets ``seq_dataset`` and weight vectors ``weight_vector``
     by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added ``partial_fit`` (support for online/minibatch learning) and
     warm_start to the :ref:`sgd` module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`svm` classes and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` merged by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Regressors can now be used as base estimator in the :ref:`multiclass`
     module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added n_jobs option to :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`
     and :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels` for parallel computation,
     by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - :ref:`k_means` can now be run in parallel, using the ``n_jobs`` argument
     to either :ref:`k_means` or :class:`KMeans`, by `Robert Layton`_.

   - Improved :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search` documentation
     and introduced the new :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     helper function by `Olivier Grisel`_

   - :class:`svm.SVC` members ``coef_`` and ``intercept_`` changed sign for
     consistency with ``decision_function``; for ``kernel==linear``,
     ``coef_`` was fixed in the one-vs-one case, by `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Performance improvements to efficient leave-one-out cross-validated
     Ridge regression, esp. for the ``n_samples > n_features`` case, in
     :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV`, by Reuben Fletcher-Costin.

   - Refactoring and simplification of the :ref:`text_feature_extraction`
     API and fixed a bug that caused possible negative IDF,
     by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module has been removed since it
     is difficult to Cythonize. If you are interested in contributing a Cython
     version, you can use the python version in the git history as a reference.

   - Classes in :ref:`neighbors` now support arbitrary Minkowski metric for
     nearest neighbors searches. The metric can be specified by argument ``p``.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` is now deprecated - Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope`
     instead.

   - ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor`` are gone in the module
     :ref:`neighbors`. Use the classes :class:`KNeighborsClassifier`,
     :class:`RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, :class:`KNeighborsRegressor`
     and/or :class:`RadiusNeighborsRegressor` instead.

   - Sparse classes in the :ref:`sgd` module are now deprecated.

   - In :class:`mixture.GMM`, :class:`mixture.DPGMM` and :class:`mixture.VBGMM`,
     parameters must be passed to an object when initialising it and not through
     ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - methods ``rvs`` and ``decode`` in :class:`GMM` module are now deprecated.
     ``sample`` and ``score`` or ``predict`` should be used instead.

   - attribute ``_scores`` and ``_pvalues`` in univariate feature selection
     objects are now deprecated.
     ``scores_`` or ``pvalues_`` should be used instead.

   - In :class:`LogisticRegression`, :class:`LinearSVC`, :class:`SVC` and
     :class:`NuSVC`, the ``class_weight`` parameter is now an initialization
     parameter, not a parameter to fit. This makes grid searches
     over this parameter possible.

   - LFW ``data`` is now always shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` to be
     consistent with the Olivetti faces dataset. Use ``images`` and
     ``pairs`` attribute to access the natural images shapes instead.

   - In :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, the meaning of the ``multi_class`` parameter
     changed.  Options now are ``'ovr'`` and ``'crammer_singer'``, with
     ``'ovr'`` being the default.  This does not change the default behavior
     but hopefully is less confusing.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.Vectorizer` is deprecated and
     replaced by :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer`.

   - The preprocessor / analyzer nested structure for text feature
     extraction has been removed. All those features are
     now directly passed as flat constructor arguments
     to :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer`, in particular the
     following parameters are now used:

       - ``analyzer`` can be ``'word'`` or ``'char'`` to switch the default
         analysis scheme, or use a specific python callable (as previously).

       - ``tokenizer`` and ``preprocessor`` have been introduced to make it
         still possible to customize those steps with the new API.

       - ``input`` explicitly control how to interpret the sequence passed to
         ``fit`` and ``predict``: filenames, file objects or direct (byte or
         Unicode) strings.

       - charset decoding is explicit and strict by default.

       - the ``vocabulary``, fitted or not is now stored in the
         ``vocabulary_`` attribute to be consistent with the project
         conventions.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` now derives directly
     from :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer` to make grid
     search trivial.

   - methods ``rvs`` in :class:`_BaseHMM` module are now deprecated.
     ``sample`` should be used instead.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module is removed since it is
     difficult to be Cythonized. If you are interested, you can look in the
     history codes by git.

   - The SVMlight format loader now supports files with both zero-based and
     one-based column indices, since both occur "in the wild".

   - Arguments in class :class:`ShuffleSplit` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``test_fraction`` and
     ``train_fraction`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Arguments in class :class:`Bootstrap` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``n_test`` and
     ``n_train`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Argument ``p`` added to classes in :ref:`neighbors` to specify an
     arbitrary Minkowski metric for nearest neighbors searches.
