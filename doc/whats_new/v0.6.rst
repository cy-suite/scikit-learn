Version 0.6
===========

**December 21, 2010**

scikit-learn 0.6 was released on December 2010. It is marked by the
inclusion of several new modules and a general renaming of old
ones. It is also marked by the inclusion of new example, including
applications to real-world datasets.


Changelog
---------

  - New `stochastic gradient
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html>`_ descent
    module by Peter Prettenhofer. The module comes with complete
    documentation and examples.

  - Improved svm module: memory consumption has been reduced by 50%,
    heuristic to automatically set class weights, possibility to
    assign weights to samples (see
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_svm_plot_weighted_samples.py` for an example).

  - New :ref:`gaussian_process` module by Vincent Dubourg. This module
    also has great documentation and some very neat examples. See
    example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_regression.py or
    example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_probabilistic_classification_after_regression.py
    for a taste of what can be done.

  - It is now possible to use liblinearâ€™s Multi-class SVC (option
    multi_class in :class:`svm.LinearSVC`)

  - New features and performance improvements of text feature
    extraction.

  - Improved sparse matrix support, both in main classes
    (:class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`) as in modules
    sklearn.svm.sparse and sklearn.linear_model.sparse.

  - Lots of cool new examples and a new section that uses real-world
    datasets was created. These include:
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_face_recognition.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_species_distribution_modeling.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_svm_gui.py`,
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py` and
    others.

  - Faster :ref:`least_angle_regression` algorithm. It is now 2x
    faster than the R version on worst case and up to 10x times faster
    on some cases.

  - Faster coordinate descent algorithm. In particular, the full path
    version of lasso (:func:`linear_model.lasso_path`) is more than
    200x times faster than before.

  - It is now possible to get probability estimates from a
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` model.

  - module renaming: the glm module has been renamed to linear_model,
    the gmm module has been included into the more general mixture
    model and the sgd module has been included in linear_model.

  - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.
