Version 0.19
============

**In Development**

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

   * :class:`sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` (bug fix)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

New features
............

   - Validation that input data contains no NaN or inf can now be suppressed
     using :func:`config_context`, at your own risk. This will save on runtime,
     and may be particularly useful for prediction time. :issue:`7548` by
     `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Added the :class:`neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` class for anomaly
     detection based on nearest neighbors.
     :issue:`5279` by `Nicolas Goix`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - The new solver ``'mu'`` implements a Multiplicate Update in
     :class:`decomposition.NMF`, allowing the optimization of all
     beta-divergences, including the Frobenius norm, the generalized
     Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence.
     :issue:`5295` by `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

   - Added the :class:`model_selection.RepeatedKFold` and
     :class:`model_selection.RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.
     :issue:`8120` by `Neeraj Gangwar`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.mean_squared_log_error`, which computes
     the mean square error of the logarithmic transformation of targets,
     particularly useful for targets with an exponential trend.
     :issue:`7655` by :user:`Karan Desai <karandesai-96>`.

   - Added solver ``'saga'`` that implements the improved version of Stochastic
     Average Gradient, in :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
     :class:`linear_model.Ridge`. It allows the use of L1 penalty with
     multinomial logistic loss, and behaves marginally better than 'sag'
     during the first epochs of ridge and logistic regression.
     :issue:`8446` by `Arthur Mensch`_.

   - Added :class:`preprocessing.QuantileTransformer` class and
     :func:`preprocessing.quantile_transform` function for features
     normalization based on quantiles.
     :issue:`8363` by :user:`Denis Engemann <dengemann>`,
     :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`, `Olivier Grisel`_, `Raghav RV`_,
     :user:`Thierry Guillemot <tguillemot>`_, and `Gael Varoquaux`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.dcg_score` and :func:`metrics.ndcg_score`, which
     compute Discounted cumulative gain (DCG) and Normalized discounted
     cumulative gain (NDCG).
     :issue:`7739` by :user:`David Gasquez <davidgasquez>`.

Enhancements
............

   - Update Sphinx-Gallery from 0.1.4 to 0.1.7 for resolving links in
     documentation build with Sphinx>1.5 :issue:`8010`, :issue:`7986` by
     :user:`Oscar Najera <Titan-C>`

   - :class:`multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor` and :class:`multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier`
     now support online learning using `partial_fit`.
     issue: `8053` by :user:`Peng Yu <yupbank>`.
   - :class:`pipeline.Pipeline` allows to cache transformers
     within a pipeline by using the ``memory`` constructor parameter.
     :issue:`7990` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

   - :class:`decomposition.PCA`, :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` and
     :class:`decomposition.TruncatedSVD` now expose the singular values
     from the underlying SVD. They are stored in the attribute
     ``singular_values_``, like in :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA`.

   - :class:`cluster.MiniBatchKMeans` and :class:`cluster.KMeans`
     now uses significantly less memory when assigning data points to their
     nearest cluster center. :issue:`7721` by :user:`Jon Crall <Erotemic>`.

   - Added ``classes_`` attribute to :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`,
     :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`,  :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`,
     and  :class:`grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV` that matches the ``classes_``
     attribute of ``best_estimator_``. :issue:`7661` and :issue:`8295`
     by :user:`Alyssa Batula <abatula>`, :user:`Dylan Werner-Meier <unautre>`,
     and :user:`Stephen Hoover <stephen-hoover>`.

   - Relax assumption on the data for the
     :class:`kernel_approximation.SkewedChi2Sampler`. Since the Skewed-Chi2
     kernel is defined on the open interval :math:`(-skewedness; +\infty)^d`,
     the transform function should not check whether ``X < 0`` but whether ``X <
     -self.skewedness``. :issue:`7573` by :user:`Romain Brault <RomainBrault>`.

   - The ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` constraint in tree construction is now
     more efficient, taking a fast path to declare a node a leaf if its weight
     is less than 2 * the minimum. Note that the constructed tree will be
     different from previous versions where ``min_weight_fraction_leaf`` is
     used. :issue:`7441` by :user:`Nelson Liu <nelson-liu>`.

   - Added ``average`` parameter to perform weights averaging in
     :class:`linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier`. :issue:`4939`
     by :user:`Andrea Esuli <aesuli>`.

   - Custom metrics for the :mod:`sklearn.neighbors` binary trees now have
     fewer constraints: they must take two 1d-arrays and return a float.
     :issue:`6288` by `Jake Vanderplas`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
     now support sparse input for prediction.
     :issue:`6101` by :user:`Ibraim Ganiev <olologin>`.

   - Added ``shuffle`` and ``random_state`` parameters to shuffle training
     data before taking prefixes of it based on training sizes in
     :func:`model_selection.learning_curve`.
     :issue:`7506` by :user:`Narine Kokhlikyan <NarineK>`.

   - Added ``norm_order`` parameter to :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel`
     to enable selection of the norm order when ``coef_`` is more than 1D.
     :issue:`6181` by :user:`Antoine Wendlinger <antoinewdg>`.

   - Added ``sample_weight`` parameter to :meth:`pipeline.Pipeline.score`.
     :issue:`7723` by :user:`Mikhail Korobov <kmike>`.

   - ``check_estimator`` now attempts to ensure that methods transform, predict, etc.
     do not set attributes on the estimator.
     :issue:`7533` by :user:`Ekaterina Krivich <kiote>`.

   - For sparse matrices, :func:`preprocessing.normalize` with ``return_norm=True``
     will now raise a ``NotImplementedError`` with 'l1' or 'l2' norm and with
     norm 'max' the norms returned will be the same as for dense matrices.
     :issue:`7771` by `Ang Lu <https://github.com/luang008>`_.

   - :class:`linear_model.RANSACRegressor` no longer throws an error
     when calling ``fit`` if no inliers are found in its first iteration.
     Furthermore, causes of skipped iterations are tracked in newly added
     attributes, ``n_skips_*``.
     :issue:`7914` by :user:`Michael Horrell <mthorrell>`.

   - :func:`model_selection.cross_val_predict` now returns output of the
     correct shape for all values of the argument ``method``.
     :issue:`7863` by :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>`.

   - Fix a bug where :class:`feature_selection.SelectFdr` did not
     exactly implement Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. It formerly may have
     selected fewer features than it should.
     :issue:`7490` by :user:`Peng Meng <mpjlu>`.

   - Added ability to set ``n_jobs`` parameter to :func:`pipeline.make_union`.
     A ``TypeError`` will be raised for any other kwargs. :issue:`8028`
     by :user:`Alexander Booth <alexandercbooth>`.

   - Added type checking to the ``accept_sparse`` parameter in
     :mod:`sklearn.utils.validation` methods. This parameter now accepts only
     boolean, string, or list/tuple of strings. ``accept_sparse=None`` is deprecated
     and should be replaced by ``accept_sparse=False``.
     :issue:`7880` by :user:`Josh Karnofsky <jkarno>`.

   - :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`, :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`
     and :func:`model_selection.cross_val_score` now allow estimators with callable
     kernels which were previously prohibited. :issue:`8005` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_ .

   - Added ability to use sparse matrices in :func:`feature_selection.f_regression`
     with ``center=True``. :issue:`8065` by :user:`Daniel LeJeune <acadiansith>`.

   - Add ``sample_weight`` parameter to :func:`metrics.cohen_kappa_score`.
     :issue:`8335` by :user:`Victor Poughon <vpoughon>`.

   - In :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, method ``predict``
     is a lot faster with ``return_std=True``. :issue:`8591` by
     :user:`Hadrien Bertrand <hbertrand>`.

   - Added ability to use sparse matrices in :func:`feature_selection.f_regression`
     with ``center=True``. :issue:`8065` by :user:`Daniel LeJeune <acadiansith>`.

   - :class:`ensemble.VotingClassifier` now allow changing estimators by using
     :meth:`ensemble.VotingClassifier.set_params`. Estimators can also be
     removed by setting it to `None`.
     :issue:`7674` by :user:`Yichuan Liu <yl565>`.

   - Prevent cast from float32 to float64 in
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` when using newton-cg
     solver. :issue:`8835` by :user:`Joan Massich <massich>`.

   - Prevent cast from float32 to float64 in
     :class:`linear_model.Ridge` when using svd, sparse_cg, cholesky or lsqr solvers
     by :user:`Joan Massich <massich>`, :user:`Nicolas Cordier <ncordier>`

   - Add ``max_train_size`` parameter to :class:`model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit`
     :issue:`8282` by :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>`.

Bug fixes
.........

   - :func:`metrics.average_precision_score` no longer linearly

     :user:`Vincent Pham <vincentpham1991>`.

   - Fix a bug in :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation`

     :issue:`8087` by :user:`Alexis Mignon <AlexisMignon>`

   - Fix :func:`multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier.predict_proba` to
     return a list of 2d arrays, rather than a 3d array. In the case where

     would be raised on trying to stack matrices with different dimensions.
     :issue:`8093` by :user:`Peter Bull <pjbull>`.

     multiple inheritance context.
     :issue:`8316` by :user:`Holger Peters <HolgerPeters>`.

   - Fix a bug in :func:`metrics.classification._check_targets`
     which would return ``'binary'`` if ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` were

     ``'multiclass'``. :issue:`8377` by `Loic Esteve`_.


   - Fix :func:`linear_model.BayesianRidge.fit` to return

     :issue:`5359` by `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.

   - Fixed a bug where :func:`model_selection.validation_curve`
     reused the same estimator for each parameter value.
     :issue:`7365` by :user:`Aleksandr Sandrovskii <Sundrique>`.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - Ensure that estimators' attributes ending with ``_`` are not set
     in the constructor but only in the ``fit`` method. Most notably,
     ensemble estimators (deriving from :class:`ensemble.BaseEnsemble`)
     now only have ``self.estimators_`` available after ``fit``.
     :issue:`7464` by `Lars Buitinck`_ and `Loic Esteve`_.

   - All checks in ``utils.estimator_checks``, in particular
     :func:`utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator` now accept estimator
     instances. Most other checks do not accept
     estimator classes any more. :issue:`9019` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Deprecate the ``doc_topic_distr`` argument of the ``perplexity`` method
     in :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` because the
     user no longer has access to the unnormalized document topic distribution
     needed for the perplexity calculation. :issue:`7954` by
     :user:`Gary Foreman <garyForeman>`.

   - Replace attribute ``named_steps`` ``dict`` to :class:`utils.Bunch`
     in :class:`pipeline.Pipeline` to enable tab completion in interactive
     environment. In the case conflict value on ``named_steps`` and ``dict``
     attribute, ``dict`` behavior will be prioritized.
     :issue:`8481` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`.

   - The :func:`multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier.predict_proba`
     function used to return a 3d array (``n_samples``, ``n_classes``,
     ``n_outputs``). In the case where different target columns had different
     numbers of classes, a `ValueError` would be raised on trying to stack
     matrices with different dimensions. This function now returns a list of
     arrays where the length of the list is ``n_outputs``, and each array is
     (``n_samples``, ``n_classes``) for that particular output.
     :issue:`8093` by :user:`Peter Bull <pjbull>`.

   - Deprecate the ``fit_params`` constructor input to the
     :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV` and
     :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` in favor
     of passing keyword parameters to the ``fit`` methods
     of those classes. Data-dependent parameters needed for model
     training should be passed as keyword arguments to ``fit``,
     and conforming to this convention will allow the hyperparameter
     selection classes to be used with tools such as
     :func:`model_selection.cross_val_predict`.
     :issue:`2879` by :user:`Stephen Hoover <stephen-hoover>`.

   - The ``decision_function`` output shape for binary classification in
     :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` and
     :class:`multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier` is now ``(n_samples,)`` to conform
     to scikit-learn conventions. :issue:`9100` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Gradient boosting base models are no longer estimators. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel` now validates the ``threshold``
     parameter and sets the ``threshold_`` attribute during the call to
     ``fit``, and no longer during the call to ``transform```, by `Andreas
     MÃ¼ller`_.

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel` now has a ``partial_fit``
     method only if the underlying estimator does. By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` now has a ``partial_fit`` method
     only if the underlying estimator does.  By `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - Estimators with both methods ``decision_function`` and ``predict_proba``
     are now required to have a monotonic relation between them. The
     method ``check_decision_proba_consistency`` has been added in
     **sklearn.utils.estimator_checks** to check their consistency.
     :issue:`7578` by :user:`Shubham Bhardwaj <shubham0704>`

   - In version 0.21, the default behavior of splitters that use the
     ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` parameter will change, such that
     specifying ``train_size`` alone will cause ``test_size`` to be the
     remainder. :issue:`7459` by :user:`Nelson Liu <nelson-liu>`.

   - All tree based estimators now accept a ``min_impurity_decrease``
     parameter in lieu of the ``min_impurity_split``, which is now deprecated.
     The ``min_impurity_decrease`` helps stop splitting the nodes in which
     the weighted impurity decrease from splitting is no longer alteast
     ``min_impurity_decrease``.  :issue:`8449` by `Raghav RV`_.

   - The ``n_topics`` parameter of :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation`
     has been renamed to ``n_components`` and will be removed in version 0.21.
     :issue:`8922` by :user:`Attractadore`

   - :class:`cluster.bicluster.SpectralCoclustering` and
     :class:`cluster.bicluster.SpectralBiclustering` now accept ``y`` in fit.
     :issue:`6126` by :user:ldirer

   - :class:`neighbors.LSHForest` has been deprecated and will be
     removed in 0.21 due to poor performance.
     :issue:`8996` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

   - SciPy >= 0.13.3 and NumPy >= 1.8.2 are now the minimum supported versions
     for scikit-learn. The following backported functions in
     :mod:`sklearn.utils` have been removed or deprecated accordingly.
     :issue:`8854` and :issue:`8874` by :user:`Naoya Kanai <naoyak>`

     Removed in 0.19:

     - ``utils.fixes.argpartition``
