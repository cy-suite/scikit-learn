Version 0.15.1
==============

**August 1, 2014**

Bug fixes
---------

   - Made :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` use
     :class:`cross_validation.KFold` instead of
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` on multi-output classification
     problems. By :user:`Nikolay Mayorov <nmayorov>`.

   - Support unseen labels :class:`preprocessing.LabelBinarizer` to restore
     the default behavior of 0.14.1 for backward compatibility. By
     :user:`Hamzeh Alsalhi <hamsal>`.

   - Fixed the :class:`cluster.KMeans` stopping criterion that prevented early
     convergence detection. By Edward Raff and `Gael Varoquaux`_.

   - Fixed the behavior of :class:`multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier`.
     in case of ties at the per-class vote level by computing the correct
     per-class sum of prediction scores. By `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Made :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` and
     :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` accept Python lists as input data.
     This is especially useful for cross-validation and model selection of
     text processing pipelines. By `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Fixed data input checks of most estimators to accept input data that
     implements the NumPy ``__array__`` protocol. This is the case for
     for ``pandas.Series`` and ``pandas.DataFrame`` in recent versions of
     pandas. By `Gael Varoquaux`_.

   - Fixed a regression for :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` with
     ``class_weight="auto"`` on data with non-contiguous labels. By
     `Olivier Grisel`_.
