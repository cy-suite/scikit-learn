Version 0.10
============

**January 11, 2012**

Changelog
---------

   - Python 2.5 compatibility was dropped; the minimum Python version needed
     to use scikit-learn is now 2.6.

   - :ref:`sparse_inverse_covariance` estimation using the graph Lasso, with
     associated cross-validated estimator, by `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - New :ref:`Tree <tree>` module by `Brian Holt`_, `Peter Prettenhofer`_,
     `Satrajit Ghosh`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_. The module comes with complete
     documentation and examples.

   - Fixed a bug in the RFE module by `Gilles Louppe`_ (issue #378).

   - Fixed a memory leak in :ref:`svm` module by `Brian Holt`_ (issue #367).

   - Faster tests by `Fabian Pedregosa`_ and others.

   - Silhouette Coefficient cluster analysis evaluation metric added as
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` by Robert Layton.

   - Fixed a bug in :ref:`k_means` in the handling of the ``n_init`` parameter:
     the clustering algorithm used to be run ``n_init`` times but the last
     solution was retained instead of the best solution by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Minor refactoring in :ref:`sgd` module; consolidated dense and sparse
     predict methods; Enhanced test time performance by converting model
     parameters to fortran-style arrays after fitting (only multi-class).

   - Adjusted Mutual Information metric added as
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score` by Robert Layton.

   - Models like SVC/SVR/LinearSVC/LogisticRegression from libsvm/liblinear
     now support scaling of C regularization parameter by the number of
     samples by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - New :ref:`Ensemble Methods <ensemble>` module by `Gilles Louppe`_ and
     `Brian Holt`_. The module comes with the random forest algorithm and the
     extra-trees method, along with documentation and examples.

   - :ref:`outlier_detection`: outlier and novelty detection, by
     :user:`Virgile Fritsch <VirgileFritsch>`.

   - :ref:`kernel_approximation`: a transform implementing kernel
     approximation for fast SGD on non-linear kernels by
     `Andreas Müller`_.

   - Fixed a bug due to atom swapping in :ref:`OMP` by `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - :ref:`SparseCoder` by `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - :ref:`mini_batch_kmeans` performance improvements by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - :ref:`k_means` support for sparse matrices by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Improved documentation for developers and for the :mod:`sklearn.utils`
     module, by `Jake Vanderplas`_.

   - Vectorized 20newsgroups dataset loader
     (:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`) by
     `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - :ref:`multiclass` by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Utilities for fast computation of mean and variance for sparse matrices
     by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Make :func:`sklearn.preprocessing.scale` and
     :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.Scaler` work on sparse matrices by
     `Olivier Grisel`_

   - Feature importances using decision trees and/or forest of trees,
     by `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Parallel implementation of forests of randomized trees by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` can subsample the train
     sets as well as the test sets by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Errors in the build of the documentation fixed by `Andreas Müller`_.


API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.9:

  - Some estimators that may overwrite their inputs to save memory previously
    had ``overwrite_`` parameters; these have been replaced with ``copy_``
    parameters with exactly the opposite meaning.

    This particularly affects some of the estimators in :mod:`linear_model`.
    The default behavior is still to copy everything passed in.

  - The SVMlight dataset loader :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_svmlight_file` no
    longer supports loading two files at once; use ``load_svmlight_files``
    instead. Also, the (unused) ``buffer_mb`` parameter is gone.

  - Sparse estimators in the :ref:`sgd` module use dense parameter vector
    ``coef_`` instead of ``sparse_coef_``. This significantly improves
    test time performance.

  - The :ref:`covariance` module now has a robust estimator of
    covariance, the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator.

  - Cluster evaluation metrics in :mod:`metrics.cluster` have been refactored
    but the changes are backwards compatible. They have been moved to the
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.supervised`, along with
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.unsupervised` which contains the Silhouette
    Coefficient.

  - The ``permutation_test_score`` function now behaves the same way as
    ``cross_val_score`` (i.e. uses the mean score across the folds.)

  - Cross Validation generators now use integer indices (``indices=True``)
    by default instead of boolean masks. This make it more intuitive to
    use with sparse matrix data.

  - The functions used for sparse coding, ``sparse_encode`` and
    ``sparse_encode_parallel`` have been combined into
    :func:`sklearn.decomposition.sparse_encode`, and the shapes of the arrays
    have been transposed for consistency with the matrix factorization setting,
    as opposed to the regression setting.

  - Fixed an off-by-one error in the SVMlight/LibSVM file format handling;
    files generated using :func:`sklearn.datasets.dump_svmlight_file` should be
    re-generated. (They should continue to work, but accidentally had one
    extra column of zeros prepended.)

  - ``BaseDictionaryLearning`` class replaced by ``SparseCodingMixin``.

  - :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.fast_svd` has been renamed
    :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd` and the default
    oversampling is now fixed to 10 additional random vectors instead
    of doubling the number of components to extract. The new behavior
    follows the reference paper.
