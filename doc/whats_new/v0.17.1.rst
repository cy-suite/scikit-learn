Bug fixes
.........


    - Upgrade vendored joblib to version 0.9.4 that fixes an important bug in
      ``joblib.Parallel`` that can silently yield to wrong results when working
      on datasets larger than 1MB:
      https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/0.9.4/CHANGES.rst

    - Fixed reading of Bunch pickles generated with scikit-learn
      version <= 0.16. This can affect users who have already
      downloaded a dataset with scikit-learn 0.16 and are loading it
      with scikit-learn 0.17. See :issue:`6196` for
      how this affected :func:`datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`. By `Loic
      Esteve`_.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented using ROC AUC score to perform grid search on
      several CPU / cores on large arrays. See :issue:`6147`
      By `Olivier Grisel`_.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented to properly set the ``presort`` parameter
      in :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`. See :issue:`5857`
      By Andrew McCulloh.

    - Fixed a joblib error when evaluating the perplexity of a
      :class:`decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` model. See :issue:`6258`
      By Chyi-Kwei Yau.
