Version 0.7
===========

**March 2, 2011**

scikit-learn 0.7 was released in March 2011, roughly three months
after the 0.6 release. This release is marked by the speed
improvements in existing algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors and
K-Means algorithm and by the inclusion of an efficient algorithm for
computing the Ridge Generalized Cross Validation solution. Unlike the
preceding release, no new modules where added to this release.

Changelog
---------

  - Performance improvements for Gaussian Mixture Model sampling [Jan
    Schl√ºter].

  - Implementation of efficient leave-one-out cross-validated Ridge in
    :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` [`Mathieu Blondel`_]

  - Better handling of collinearity and early stopping in
    :func:`linear_model.lars_path` [`Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Fabian
    Pedregosa`_].

  - Fixes for liblinear ordering of labels and sign of coefficients
    [Dan Yamins, Paolo Losi, `Mathieu Blondel`_ and `Fabian Pedregosa`_].

  - Performance improvements for Nearest Neighbors algorithm in
    high-dimensional spaces [`Fabian Pedregosa`_].

  - Performance improvements for :class:`cluster.KMeans` [`Gael
    Varoquaux`_ and `James Bergstra`_].

  - Sanity checks for SVM-based classes [`Mathieu Blondel`_].

  - Refactoring of :class:`neighbors.NeighborsClassifier` and
    :func:`neighbors.kneighbors_graph`: added different algorithms for
    the k-Nearest Neighbor Search and implemented a more stable
    algorithm for finding barycenter weights. Also added some
    developer documentation for this module, see
    `notes_neighbors
    <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Neighbors-working-notes>`_ for more information [`Fabian Pedregosa`_].

  - Documentation improvements: Added :class:`pca.RandomizedPCA` and
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` to the class
    reference. Also added references of matrices used for clustering
    and other fixes [`Gael Varoquaux`_, `Fabian Pedregosa`_, `Mathieu
    Blondel`_, `Olivier Grisel`_, Virgile Fritsch , Emmanuelle
    Gouillart]

  - Binded decision_function in classes that make use of liblinear_,
    dense and sparse variants, like :class:`svm.LinearSVC` or
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` [`Fabian Pedregosa`_].

  - Performance and API improvements to
    :func:`metrics.euclidean_distances` and to
    :class:`pca.RandomizedPCA` [`James Bergstra`_].

  - Fix compilation issues under NetBSD [Kamel Ibn Hassen Derouiche]

  - Allow input sequences of different lengths in :class:`hmm.GaussianHMM`
    [`Ron Weiss`_].

  - Fix bug in affinity propagation caused by incorrect indexing [Xinfan Meng]
