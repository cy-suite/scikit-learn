Version 0.9
===========

**September 21, 2011**

scikit-learn 0.9 was released on September 2011, three months after the 0.8
release and includes the new modules :ref:`manifold`, :ref:`dirichlet_process`
as well as several new algorithms and documentation improvements.

This release also includes the dictionary-learning work developed by
`Vlad Niculae`_ as part of the `Google Summer of Code
<https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc>`_ program.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.8:

  - The ``scikits.learn`` package was renamed ``sklearn``. There is
    still a ``scikits.learn`` package alias for backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance, under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bscikits.learn\b/sklearn/g'

  - Estimators no longer accept model parameters as ``fit`` arguments:
    instead all parameters must be only be passed as constructor
    arguments or using the now public ``set_params`` method inherited
    from :class:`base.BaseEstimator`.

    Some estimators can still accept keyword arguments on the ``fit``
    but this is restricted to data-dependent values (e.g. a Gram matrix
    or an affinity matrix that are precomputed from the ``X`` data matrix.

  - The ``cross_val`` package has been renamed to ``cross_validation``
    although there is also a ``cross_val`` package alias in place for
    backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance, under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bcross_val\b/cross_validation/g'

  - The ``score_func`` argument of the
    ``sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`` function is now expected
    to accept ``y_test`` and ``y_predicted`` as only arguments for
    classification and regression tasks or ``X_test`` for unsupervised
    estimators.

  - ``gamma`` parameter for support vector machine algorithms is set
    to ``1 / n_features`` by default, instead of ``1 / n_samples``.

  - The ``sklearn.hmm`` has been marked as orphaned: it will be removed
    from scikit-learn in version 0.11 unless someone steps up to
    contribute documentation, examples and fix lurking numerical
    stability issues.

  - ``sklearn.neighbors`` has been made into a submodule.  The two previously
    available estimators, ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor``
    have been marked as deprecated.  Their functionality has been divided
    among five new classes: ``NearestNeighbors`` for unsupervised neighbors
    searches, ``KNeighborsClassifier`` & ``RadiusNeighborsClassifier``
    for supervised classification problems, and ``KNeighborsRegressor``
    & ``RadiusNeighborsRegressor`` for supervised regression problems.

  - ``sklearn.ball_tree.BallTree`` has been moved to
    ``sklearn.neighbors.BallTree``.  Using the former will generate a warning.

  - ``sklearn.linear_model.LARS()`` and related classes (LassoLARS,
    LassoLARSCV, etc.) have been renamed to
    ``sklearn.linear_model.Lars()``.

  - All distance metrics and kernels in ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise`` now have a Y
    parameter, which by default is None. If not given, the result is the distance
    (or kernel similarity) between each sample in Y. If given, the result is the
    pairwise distance (or kernel similarity) between samples in X to Y.

  - ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise.l1_distance`` is now called ``manhattan_distance``,
    and by default returns the pairwise distance. For the component wise distance,
    set the parameter ``sum_over_features`` to ``False``.

Backward compatibility package aliases and other deprecated classes and
functions will be removed in version 0.11.
