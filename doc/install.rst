Installing scikit-learn
=======================

There are different ways to get scikit-learn installed:

  * :ref:`Install the latest official release <install_official_release>`. This
    is the best approach for most users. It will provide a stable version
    and pre-build packages are available for most platforms.

  * Install the version of scikit-learn provided by your
    :ref:`operating system or Python distribution <install_by_distribution>`.
    This is a quick option for those who have operating systems or Python
    distributions that distribute scikit-learn.
    It might not provide the latest release version.

  * :ref:`Building the package from source
    <install_bleeding_edge>`. This is best for users who want the
    latest-and-greatest features and aren't afraid of running
    brand-new code.

.. _install_official_release:

Installing the latest release
=============================

Scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 3.5)
- NumPy (>= 1.11.0)
- SciPy (>= 0.17.0)
- joblib (>= 0.11)

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with "plot\_"
and classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= 1.5.1). For running the
examples Matplotlib >= 1.5.1 is required. A few examples require
scikit-image >= 0.12.3, a few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0.

.. warning::

    Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
    Scikit-learn now requires Python 3.5 or newer.

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

or ``pip``.
In that case, in order to avoid any OS dependent issue it is strongly
recommended to use python3 ``virtualenv``
(see `python3 virtualenv documentation
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_).

That gives, on Linux::

    python -m venv .myenv
    source .myenv/bin/activate
    pip install -U scikit-learn

or on Windows::

    python -m venv .myenv
    .myenv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -U scikit-learn

.. note::

   Some OSes still link Python v3 executable as ``python3``. Previous commands
   need to be changed accordingly.

If you have not installed NumPy or SciPy yet, you can also install these using
conda or pip. When using pip, please ensure that *binary wheels* are used,
and NumPy and SciPy are not recompiled from source, which can happen when using
particular configurations of operating system and hardware (such as Linux on
a Raspberry Pi). 

If you must install scikit-learn and its dependencies with pip, you can install
it as ``scikit-learn[alldeps]``.

.. note::

   For installing on PyPy, PyPy3-v5.10+, Numpy 1.14.0+, and scipy 1.1.0+
   are required.

.. _install_by_distribution:

Third party distributions of scikit-learn
=========================================

Some third-party distributions provide versions of
scikit-learn integrated with their package-management systems.

These can make installation and upgrading much easier for users since
the integration includes the ability to automatically install
dependencies (numpy, scipy) that scikit-learn requires.

The following is an incomplete list of OS and python distributions
that provide their own version of scikit-learn.

Arch Linux
----------

Arch Linux's package is provided through the `official repositories
<https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=scikit-learn>`_ as
``python-scikit-learn`` for Python.
It can be installed by typing the following command:

.. code-block:: none

     # pacman -S python-scikit-learn


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

The Debian/Ubuntu package is splitted in three different packages called
``python3-sklearn`` (python modules), ``python3-sklearn-lib`` (low-level
implementations and bindings), ``python3-sklearn-doc`` (documentation).
Only the Python 3 version is available in the Debian Buster (the more recent
Debian distribution).
Packages can be installed using ``apt-get``::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-sklearn python3-sklearn-lib
          python3-sklearn-doc


Fedora
------

The Fedora package is called ``python3-scikit-learn`` for the python 3 version,
the only one available in Fedora30.
It can be installed using ``dnf``::

    $ sudo dnf install python3-scikit-learn


NetBSD
------

scikit-learn is available via `pkgsrc-wip
<http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/>`_:

    http://pkgsrc.se/wip/py-scikit_learn


MacPorts for Mac OSX
--------------------

The MacPorts package is named ``py<XY>-scikits-learn``,
where ``XY`` denotes the Python version.
It can be installed by typing the following
command::

    sudo port install py27-scikit-learn

or::

    sudo port install py36-scikit-learn


Canopy and Anaconda for all supported platforms
-----------------------------------------------

`Canopy
<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy>`_ and `Anaconda
<https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ both ship a recent
version of scikit-learn, in addition to a large set of scientific python
library for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

Anaconda offers scikit-learn as part of its free distribution.


WinPython for Windows
-----------------------

The `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ project distributes
scikit-learn as an additional plugin.
