Engage with the scikit-learn community and seek answers to your questions:

- **Stack Overflow**: Some scikit-learn developers support users using the 
  `[scikit-learn] <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scikit-learn>`_ 
  tag.

- **General Machine Learning Queries**: For broader machine learning 
  discussions, visit `Stack Exchange <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`_.

When posting questions:

- Please use a descriptive question in the title field (e.g. no "Please 
  help with scikit-learn!" as this is not a question) 

- Provide detailed context, expected results, and actual observations.

- Include code and data snippets (preferably minimalistic scripts, 
  up to ~20 lines).

- Describe your data and preprocessing steps, including sample size, 
  feature types (categorical or numerical), and the target for supervised 
  learning tasks (classification type or regression).

**Note**: Avoid asking user questions on the bug tracker to keep 
the focus on development.

<https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues>`_

Include in your report:

- Steps or scripts to reproduce the bug.

- Expected and observed outcomes.

- Python or gdb tracebacks, if applicable.

- The ideal bug report contains a :ref:`short reproducible code snippet
  <minimal_reproducer>`, this way anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily.

- If your snippet is longer than around 50 lines, please link to a 
  `gist <https://gist.github.com>`_ or a github repo.

**Tip**: Gists are Git repositories; you can push data files to them using Git.
